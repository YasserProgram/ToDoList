# ToDoList

This is a simple to-do list application developed in Python using the Tkinter library. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and remove them from the list. Tasks are saved in a file for persistence.

## Features

- **Add Task:** Users can add new tasks by typing the task name and clicking the "Add task" button.

- **Mark Task as Completed:** Tasks can be marked as completed by clicking on them in the list.

- **Delete Task:** Tasks can be removed from the list by clicking the "Delete task" button next to each task.

- **Save Tasks:** Tasks are automatically saved to a file (`tasks.txt`) so that users can load them in future sessions.

## Requirements
Make sure you have a tasks.txt file in the same directory for tasks to be saved properly
To run the application, make sure you have Python installed and the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Usage

1. Run the `main.py` file to start the application.
2. Add your tasks.
3. Mark tasks as completed or delete them as needed.
4. Tasks will be saved automatically and available in future sessions.
